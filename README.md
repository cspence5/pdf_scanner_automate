# pdf_scanner_automate
changes the name of pdf based on content inside the file 

Simple but nifty little C#/.Net application that is a developer tool to quickly change the name of PDFs so that the content of the 
pdf can be established just by reading the title.(The application looks for the unique identifier inside the pdf
 checks the number against an oracle database to get customer name and appends both to the title of the pdf for filing
 and archiving). Stops the headache of manually opening thousands of pdfs and renaming.
